/*Task # 12: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead 
of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each 
message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the 
person’s name.*/

/* Prints a message for each person's name by accessing each element in the list
